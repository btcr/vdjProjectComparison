The main script (comparison.py) runs comparisons for the percent of correct gene calls on VDJ Alignment projects packaged into bioboxes. 

The current possible actions of comparison include:
-add new biobox: add a new biobox to the list for comparisons 
-compare current bioboxes: output comparisons of current bioboxes into a csv file
-running with different simulated data files

Standards necessary for biobox comparison:
In addition to the standards mentioned on http://bioboxes.org/ all bioboxes must have the following:
-script to run plotperformance
-Input yaml file generator 
-Shell script to automate the docker commands, calling plot script, writing to dataFile.txt
-Must have ROOT installed to run comparisons 
Projects partis and mixcr contain example scripts. 

Current known problems:
-lots of packages that support plot performance such as root need to be installed
