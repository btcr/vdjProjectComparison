#8-18-15
=====================
1. Git clone this repository: https://github.com/btcr/bioboxmixcr.git
2. Navigate into the input_data directory and run YamlFileGenerator.py. Here you will enter all the parameters for generating the 
input. Make sure the resulting file (biobox.yml) is in the inputDir directory.
3. Navigate back to the main directory and build the docker image from the docker file "docker build -t <name of image> ."
4. To run the program, use this docker command: docker run --volume="$(pwd)/inputDir:/bbx/input:ro" --volume="$(pwd)/outputDir:/bbx/output:rw" <name of image> 

You should now see the output files in the directory you specified.
=====================
-You must have docker installed to run this program.
-The --volume tags in the Docker command will link the directory on your local machine to directories within the docker container
-This current version only contains a limited number of parameters for the export function of Mixcr.
-'mixcrparser.py', the script that will plot this project's performance, is located in the dev directory under 'plotPython' (must have ROOT installed to run)
-The dev directory contains previous test scripts as well as the 'plotPython' directory mentioned above
